# The filter Game, version 1.0.0

Welcome to The Filter Game.
Want to know the magic of filters in mathematics? Play it!

There are seven worlds in this game:

* World 0       : This world contains basic contents of filters.
* World 1       : We introduce the filter basis and discuss relevant properties of 
                  it in this world.
* World 2       : Given two filters (or filter basis) F and G,
                  we talk about how to define F â‰¤ G in this world.
* World 3       : This world discusses the principal filters and relevant properties.
* World 4       : This world discusses the ultrafilters which is the minimal 
                  (maximal in the set order) proper filterand relevant properties.
* World 5       : One of the applications of filters is about topology, 
                  and we will go through some of them in this world.
* World 6       : This world contains some challenging puzzles.

It's recommended to start with world 0, then go to world 1...

This filter game is motivated by the natural number game
written by Prof. Kevin Buzzard and Dr. Mohammad Pedramfar. I would recommand to
play the natural number game first to get more sense how does Lean work.
